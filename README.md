# scRNAseq_rawls5532
Collection of work for the single-cell RNA sequencing dataset described in the following: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.13.422569

This will include two functions (that will be periodically updated) that were used as part of custom scripts that interface with the packages `tidyverse` and `Seurat`. I will also include code used to process the data, and some examples of figures generated.
